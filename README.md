# TypeScript Language Repository

Welcome to the TypeScript Language Repository! This repository is dedicated to the development, documentation, and community support for the TypeScript programming language.

4. Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:


5. Run the compiled JavaScript code using Node.js:
